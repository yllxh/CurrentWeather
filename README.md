# CurrentWeather
A simple android weather app.

## How to run the project

You need to have a weather api key from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org).

Once you have the key import the project to Android Studio and create a new constant 
called WEATHER_API_KEY either in the WeatherApiService file or on a seperate file.
